# Tic-Tac-Toe or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces 
in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both 
players.
